# Node and Npm

Youâ€™ll need Node.js installed on your computer to get started with workshops and javascript projects.

Npm is a package manager (that comes with node).

We would recommend entering the following commands and doing the workshop to learn how to use npm.

```npm install -g how-to-npm
how-to-npm```
