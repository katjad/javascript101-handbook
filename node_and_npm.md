# Node and Npm

Youâ€™ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer to get started with workshops and javascript projects.

[Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager (that comes with node), has a rich ecosystem of javascript modules that have been made by the community.

We would recommend entering the following commands and doing the workshop to learn how to use npm.

```
npm install -g how-to-npm
how-to-npm
```


> If you are having difficulty getting set up ask someone for help at the Javascript 101 meet up or [online](https://gitter.im/CodeHubOrg/discussions).
