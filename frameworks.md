We recommend being comfortable with the core javascript concepts and functional programming basics before venturing into using the following recommended frameworks.

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a revolutionary and popular client-side framework made by Facebook. Free Code Camp teach React.

[Choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo) is a fun framework that we might be using more of!

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is a Node framework for server-side applications.

## Todo App

The classic framework example is the todo app.  You can see how the frameworks compare at [todomvc](http://todomvc.com/)

## Give It Five minutes

Why not give a framework that you hear about [five minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes)?  You don't have to spend days on it, however a bit of investigation could go a long way.
