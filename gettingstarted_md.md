# Getting Started

## Gitter

We use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/CodeHubOrg/discussions) as a group chat and to send links etc. Create a github account and login!

## Drop Box

We use [Drop Box](https://www.dropbox.com) to share useful books and other resources.

## CodeHub Discussions

See what we have been up to over the previous sessions by reading Katja's excellent write ups on the [discussions board](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/discussions/issues/).

## Operating System

We recommend using Linux\(Ubuntu\) or Mac for development due to the Linux Terminal. If you are using Windows you could try setting up a Virtual Machine to run Ubuntu.

## Editing Code

There are many ways to edit code, find one which suits your needs:

### Browser Based

[Code Pen](https://codepen.io/)

### Text Editor

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is written in Javascript and is hackable! MS Visual Code is open source and also pretty swish.

### IDE

[Web Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) the best IDE around at the moment, ideal for big projects.

### Old School

If you want to get old school install vim via the command line and never use your mouse again!

> Pro Tip: Install vim and type vimtutor in your terminal to take it for a spin!

## Recommended Reading

We would recommend starting off by reading a book on Javascript to get familar with the basics.

[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a group favourite as it is well written, complete with exercises and available free online.

It's particularly important with Javascipt to make sure the resources you're using are up to date... a resource that's just a couple of years old can be way out of date; Javascript frameworks and methods are evolving rapidly.
