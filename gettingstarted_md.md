# Getting Started

##Gitter

We use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/CodeHubOrg/discussions) as a group chat and to send links etc. Create a github account and login!

##Drop Box

We use Drop Box to share useful books and other resources.

##CodeHub Discussions
See what we have been up to over the previous sessions by reading Katja's excellent write ups on the [discussions board](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/discussions/issues/).

##Operating System

We recommend using Linux(Ubuntu) or Mac for development due to the Linux Terminal. If you are using Windows you could try setting up a Virtual Machine to run Ubuntu.

##Editing Code

There are many ways to edit code, find one which suits your needs:

###Browser Based

Code Pen

###Text Editor

Atom is written in Javascript and is hackable!

###IDE

Web Storm the best IDE around at the moment, ideal for big projects.

###Old School

If you want to get old school use vim and never use your mouse again!


> Pro Tip: Install vim and type vimtutor in your terminal to take it for a spin!
