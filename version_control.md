# Version Control

In order to manage your own code and share code with others you need to use version control.

## Git
Git is the standard version control system for open source and professional projects.

You can view our projects on [Github/CodeHub](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/)

Using git is easy once you know how!  You just need to know the basic concepts and commands to get going.

A great way to learn is by doing a workshop.  Open a terminal window and type the following:
```
npm install -g git-it
git-it
```
