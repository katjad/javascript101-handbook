# Debugging


## Browser Dev Tools
You can view error messages in the browser console.  We recommend using Chrome as your browser but the others have very similar dev tools too.

## console.log is your friend

You can debug your code by logging to the browser/terminal console:
```
const foobar = 'orly!?'
console.log('debug something: ', foobar)
```

## Google
Learn how to search properly.  For example if you wanted to find out more about the ES6 spread operator (...), don't search for '...'!

## Stack OverFlow
If you have a bug search [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) first, it's probably been experienced before!
