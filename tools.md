## Browser Dev Tools
You can view page elements, the browser console and other useful features via dev tools.  We recommend using Chrome as your browsers but the others have very similar dev tools too.

## Console.log is your friend

You can debug your code using the console log command and view the result in your browser dev tools.
```
console.log('debug', foobar)
```
