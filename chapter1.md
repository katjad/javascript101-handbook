# About

Javascript 101 is a [CodeHub Bristol](https://www.meetup.com/CodeHub-Bristol/) meet up group that meets up every other Tuesday at 10am - 1pm at the [Beatroot cafe](http://www.beatrootcafe.com/) in Bristol, UK.

The main intention is to support and encourage each other; having a space reserved that is dedicated to learning JS. We might prepare [little talks](https://javascript101.gitbooks.io/guide/content/presentations.html), but it is not primarily about teaching, rather self-directed learning.

## Format
The major part of each session is coding. We suggest certain topics (so far we have done the coding challenges in [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)), but you can just as well bring your own project to work on; you can also work through [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) or similar. If you get stuck with any of these, feel free to ask others for help.
We have some time before and after the coding session where people can present something they are working on.

We have also had "whiteboard sessions" where we have talked about
programming concepts, for example different ways to declare a
function.

## Is this group for me?[](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
Is it for you? That's difficult to tell in advance, of course. We would say there is an emphasis on JavaScript as a programming language, not so much moving quickly to libraries like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to achieve all kinds of effects. 

All skill levels are welcome!

## Related Meet Ups
CodeHub also organises a hack night at the Moment Offices every other Tuesday 6pm - 9pm.

[Bristol JS](https://www.meetup.com/BristolJS/) is another great meet up group that holds talks and a social in the pub afterwards. 

Simple Web holds hack nights from time to time.
