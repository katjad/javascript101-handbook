# Getting Started

## Operating System
We recommend using Linux(Ubuntu) or Mac for development due to the Linux Terminal.  You can also use Windows.

## Text Editor / IDE
There are many editors for coding out there including in the browser.  

We would recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) as it is written in Javascript and is hackable!

If you want something a more powerful IDE we would recommend [Web Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

If you want to get old school use vim and never use your mouse again!


> Pro Tip:  Install vim and type vimtutor in your terminal to take it for a spin!

## Recommend Reading
We would recommend starting off by reading a book on Javascript to get familar with the basics.

[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a group favourite it is well written, complete with exercises and available online.
