# Getting Started

## Gitter
We use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) as a group chat and to send links etc.  Create a github account and login! 

## Operating System
We recommend using Linux(Ubuntu) or Mac for development due to the Linux Terminal.  If you are using Windows you could try [setting up a Virtual Machine to run Ubuntu](http://www.instructables.com/id/Introduction-38/).

## Editing Code 
There are many ways to edit code, find one which suits your needs:  

###Browser Based
* [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/)

###Text Editor
[Atom](https://atom.io/) is written in Javascript and is hackable!

### IDE
[Web Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) the best IDE around at the moment, ideal for big projects.

### Old School
If you want to get old school use vim and never use your mouse again!

> Pro Tip:  Install vim and type vimtutor in your terminal to take it for a spin!

## Recommend Reading
We would recommend starting off by reading a book on Javascript to get familar with the basics.

[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a group favourite it is well written, complete with exercises and available online.
