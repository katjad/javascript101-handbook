##GTL
An acronym standing for Grok, Trunk, Live.  Adapted from the seminal talk [Learn Brogramming, The Hard Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWsAQsydzR4) by Chad.

## Grok
Learn something new everyday.

## Trunk
Trunk is more than just the SVN directory. 

Trunking is a way of life; it's expanding the tools in your programming tool belt to make you adapt to any situation.

## Live
Life is short; programmers live it up.
