![](yoda.jpg)
In the book Outliers, author Malcolm Gladwell says that it takes roughly [ten thousand hours](http://wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/) of practice to achieve mastery in a field.  

You may not need to become a Jedi Master, but to get anywhere you are going to have dedicate some practice in on a regular basis.

This is the foundation of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) where after a years full time study you should reach a proficient level.


## Read the Source, Luke
Take the time to read the source code of other projects.  It will help you write beautiful code in no time.


## Meet Ups
Go to a meet up and talk to other developers.  It's a great way to find out what's happening in the world of Javascript.

## Confusion
> Remember if you feel confused, thats's good!  It means you are learning something!
       - Fun Fun Function

##GTL
An acronym standing for Grok, Trunk, Live.  

Adapted from the seminal talk [Learn Brogramming, The Hard Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWsAQsydzR4) by Chad.

## Grok
Learn something new everyday.

## Trunk
Trunk is more than just the SVN directory. 

Trunking is a way of life; it's expanding the tools in your programming tool belt to make you adapt to any situation.

## Live
Life is short; don't forget to have fun.
