# Best Practices

## Hammock Driven Development
Before you dive into coding, take a step back and think about the problem.


> "A few weeks of hard work can save a few hours of careful planning"

A note pad and pen are the best tools for planning your solution and will save you a lot of time and headaches.


> "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code."

        — John Johnson

## Structure your code
* Modules
* Functions
* Patterns

## Single Responsibility Principle
Your functions and objects should do one thing only and do it well.

## KISS
Keep it simple, stupid.



> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

        — Leonardo da Vinci





## DRY
[Don't repeat yourself!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)  If you find yourself writing the same code more than twice, break it out into a function.

## YAGNI
[You ain't gonna need it!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it)  Don't add functionality until you need it.

## Reuse Code
Is there a module, tool or framework already written that fits your solution?


> "Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)"
        - Eric S. Raymond

## Clean Code
Keep your code readable.  You and others will thank you in the future!

## Iteration
Remember software development is an iterative process.  Don't expect to write it perfect first time.  Make it good enough and then refactor your code to make it better.

## Pair Programming
Two heads are better than one!

## Have Fun!

> "Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program." 
        - Linus Torvalds
