# Best Practices

## Hammock Driven Development
Before you dive into coding, take a step back and think about the problem.


> "A few weeks of hard work can save a few hours of careful planning"

A note pad and pen are the best tools for planning your solution and will save you a lot of time and headaches.


> "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code."

        — John Johnson

## Single Responsibility Principle
Your functions and objects should do one thing only and do it well.

## KISS
Keep it simple, stupid.



> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

        — Leonardo da Vinci


## DRY
[Don't repeat yourself!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)  If you find yourself writing the same code more than twice, break it out into a function.

## YAGNI
[You ain't gonna need it!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it)  Don't add functionality until you need it.

## Structure Code
* Modules
* Functions
* Patterns

## Reuse Code
Is there a module, tool or framework already written that fits your solution?

## Clean Code
Keep your code readable.  You and others will thank you in the future!

## Iteration
Remember software development is an iterative process.  Don't expect to write it perfect first time.  Make it good enough and then refactor your code to make it better next time.

## Pair Programming
Two heads are better than one!

## Code Reviews
![](https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2009/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707a45970c-pi.png)
Ask someone to review you code for feedback. 


## Coding Standards
https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js

[ESlint](http://eslint.org/)

## Testing
Learn how to practice TDD/BDD it will help you write decoupled code with less bugs.

## Use the source control, Luke!
Use source control, what would happen if the dog ate your codes?

## Documentation
Comment your code, however if you have well structured [clean code](http://ricardogeek.com/docs/clean_code.pdf) with descriptive functions and variables the code should speak for it's self.

## Design Patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.  They allow us to stand on the shoulders of the combined experience of the many developers that came before us.

## Anti Patterns
[You don't want to do it like that.](https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/software-development-antipatterns)

## Copy & Paste Variables
Copy and paste variable to avoid error messages from spelling mistakes.  Try not to copy and paste code from Stack Overflow and other places without trying to understand how it works.

## Keep learning
Never stop learning.  There are so many resources out there.  Try other languages.  Talk to other developers.  What's happening in the community?  Keep adding new tools to your belt, then you have more options for your solutions.

## Have Fun!
